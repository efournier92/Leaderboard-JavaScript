#Leaderboard JavaScript 

This repo contains an JS application I built to practice writing logic in plain JavaScript. The concept was to input raw data about NFL games, and automatically output a clean and well-styled leaderboard based on the input data.

###The leaderboard contains the following elements:
* Name
* Rank (based on wins)
* Wins (total number of wins)
* Losses (total number of losses)

###My logic does the following:
* Defines a constructor that returns an object with the leaderboard elements
* Creates an array containing the data defined in `leaderboard.js`, corresponding to each team. 
* Orders team by rank, based on number of wins
